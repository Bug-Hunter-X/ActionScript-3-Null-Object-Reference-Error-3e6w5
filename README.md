# ActionScript 3 Null Object Reference Error

This repository demonstrates a common ActionScript 3 error: attempting to access a property or method of a null object reference.  The `bug.as` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.as` provides a corrected version.

**Problem:**
The issue arises when an object reference is unexpectedly null, leading to a runtime error.  This often occurs due to asynchronous operations, incorrect object initialization, or improper error handling.

**Solution:**
The solution involves carefully checking for null values before attempting to access properties or methods.  This often necessitates incorporating null checks using conditional statements (if statements) or the optional chaining operator (?.)  when available.
